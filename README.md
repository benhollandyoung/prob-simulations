# Erdos-Renyi Graph Generator and Visualizer

This project implements an **Erdős–Rényi random graph** generator in C++ using the \( G(n, p) \) model, and automatically visualises the generated graph using a **Python script** with `matplotlib` and `networkx`.

---

## 📦 Features

- Generate a random undirected graph with `n` vertices and edge probability `p`
- Export graph as an edge list
- Compute and display:
  - Adjacency matrix
  - Edge list
  - Graph statistics (edges, degrees, density, etc.)
- **Automatically run a Python script to visualise the graph**


---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- C++ compiler (Clang or GCC)
- Python 3 (with `venv`, `matplotlib`, and `networkx`)
- Unix-like OS (macOS/Linux recommended) or Windows with path adjustments
